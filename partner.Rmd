### Zack Larson (Zclarson)

In the most recent commit, Zack added 2 files called 'hw1.Rmd' and 'hw1.html'. The commit ID is 03214e72b401c9d60eb25d18a9d581a592435f44.

I was able to knit Zack's 'hw1.Rmd' without any errors.

A tip for making Git/GitHub easier to use would be to make sure that commit messages are meaningful so that people know specifically what each update consisted of.
